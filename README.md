An "online tea bar" where you enter what you want to drink to a menu, drink it, and then have your refreshment placed into a beverage history. Created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Used MVC design pattern, Node, MySQL, and Handlebars.

Future plans are to recreate with sequalize and clean up some of the design.
